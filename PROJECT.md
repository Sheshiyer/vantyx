# Vantyx

## Packet status

This is the canonical project entry point for the `panaroma-webapp`
repository. This packet is **draft-held** — drafted from registry and
repository evidence, not yet reviewed by a human. No path move, registry
write, session migration, or provider change is implied by this packet.

## Registry evidence

- Portfolio: `thoughtseed`
- Repository: `panaroma-webapp`
- Registry WorkObject: `sapling:vantyx` (`Vantyx`, kind: sapling)
- GitHub: `Sheshiyer/vantyx` (identity_status: pending-teamforge-verification)
- Knowledge authority: `00-meta/system-of-records.md` (placeholder — no vault: sourceRef found, needs review)
- Current packet checkpoint: `.project/HANDOFF.md`

## Authority and pickup

Codex is the default interactive governor for this repository. Claude,
OpenCode, and Kimi may pick up the bounded files listed in
`.project/project.yaml`. OmniRoute may route model calls beneath that
control rail; it does not own project identity, repository history, native
sessions, or vault knowledge.

Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.project/CONTEXT.md`, and
`.project/HANDOFF.md` before changing the repository. Native client
sessions, Paseo workspaces, provider stores, and credentials are
intentionally outside this packet.

## Local commands

```bash
bun install
bun run test
```

`bun run test` is the current deterministic verification
command.
